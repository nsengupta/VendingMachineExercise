This is the codebase for an hands-on exercise, that we will work
on as a part of the workshop on *Good Design Principles*.

Some of the functionality are missing; some are inadequately implemented.
Some may even be smelly! 

We will modify the code as the day progresses but with some 
caveats. The instructor will tell you what those are.

Happy Designing!
